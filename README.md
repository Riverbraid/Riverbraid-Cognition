# McLean (2026) Primary Coherence Anchor

# Riverbraid-Cognition: The Refusal Engine (v1.0.0)

## Overview
This is the **Aperture** of the Riverbraid Sovereignty Protocol. It is not a dataset-centric learning model; it is a **Rule-and-Anchor** centric meaning processor. 

## Primary Invariants
* **Meaning as Frequency:** Meaning is the internal frequency of a system successfully navigating environmental entropy.
* **Fail-Closed:** Any detection of coupling between external noise and internal core results in an immediate execution halt.
* **Stationary State:** All cognition is gated by the Merkle Root `de2062`.

## Cognitive Gates
1. **Coupling Test:** Ensures $I(Core; Signal) quiv 0$.
2. **Scale Separation:** Segregates token processing from meaning derivation.
3. **Linearity Filter:** Rejects sequential, time-bound data as non-primary.

## Governance
This petal is governed by `identity.contract.json` and verified via `verify.mjs`. No dynamic time (`Date`) or randomness (`Math.random`) is permitted within this boundary.
