### 1. The Coupling Invariant
All governed logic is purged of environmental entropy. 
- **Scale Separation:** The verifier (`verify.mjs`) is an inspector, not a subject.
- **Fail-Closed:** Any inclusion of `process.env` or `Date.now` in the governed surface triggers immediate rejection.

### 2. Canonical Fingerprint
- **GPG Fingerprint:** D9475D6B717D0E6C8EC84F6D8F86D9F4F2B083A4
- **Merkle Root:** de2062 (Validated 2026-02-25)

### 3. Cognitive Signature
This build represents the transition from Dataset-Centric to Rule-and-Anchor-Centric intelligence. Meaning is primary; tokens are secondary.
